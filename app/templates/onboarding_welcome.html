    <h1>Welcome to MeetConfirm!</h1>
    <p>Thank you for deploying the application. My name is Michal, and I'm the creator of this project.</p>
    <p>This project runs on a powerful stack: FastAPI, Google Cloud Run, Firestore, and the Google Calendar & Gmail APIs. It's designed to be cost-effective, leveraging the generous free tiers provided by Google Cloud.</p>
    <p><b>What happens next?</b></p>
    <p>In a few moments, I will automatically create a test event in your Google Calendar. You will then receive a standard confirmation email, just like your clients would. You can interact with it to see the full workflow.</p>
    <p>Thank you for trying out MeetConfirm!</p>
