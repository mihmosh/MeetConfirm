# MeetConfirm Quick Start Guide

Get MeetConfirm running in under 20 minutes with our automated deployment script!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- ‚úÖ A Google Cloud account with billing enabled
- ‚úÖ `gcloud` CLI installed ([Install Guide](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install))
- ‚úÖ A Google Calendar with a public booking page

### Quick Install

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install google-cloud-sdk jq
```

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
sudo apt-get install jq
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Only gcloud is required - jq will be downloaded automatically!
# Download from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
# Or use Chocolatey:
choco install gcloudsdk
```

> **Note for Windows users:** The deployment script will automatically download `jq` if it's not found on your system. No package manager required!

## One-Command Deployment

We've automated 95% of the deployment process. 

**For Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

**For Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\scripts\deploy.ps1
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Check all requirements
2. ‚úÖ Help you configure or create a GCP project
3. ‚úÖ Enable all necessary Google Cloud APIs
4. ‚úÖ Guide you through OAuth credential creation (2 manual steps)
5. ‚úÖ Obtain your refresh token
6. ‚úÖ Securely store all secrets in Secret Manager
7. ‚úÖ Create and configure Cloud SQL database
8. ‚úÖ Create Cloud Tasks queue
9. ‚úÖ Build and deploy to Cloud Run
10. ‚úÖ Set up Google Calendar webhooks

## What You'll Need to Do Manually

The script will pause at two points where human interaction is required:

### Step 1: Download OAuth Credentials (2 minutes)

The script will provide you with a direct link and clear instructions:

1. Open the provided Google Cloud Console URL
2. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app)
3. Download the JSON file as `client_secret.json`
4. Press Enter to continue

**Why manual?** Google requires OAuth Client ID creation through their console for security.

### Step 2: Authorize the Application (1 minute)

The script will automatically:
- Open your browser
- Show you exactly what permissions you're granting
- Wait for you to sign in and approve

**Why manual?** OAuth security requires explicit human consent. This is a one-time step.

## Configuration During Deployment

The script will ask you for:

| Setting | Example | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **GCP Project ID** | `my-startup-prod` | Your Google Cloud project |
| **Region** | `us-central1` | Where to deploy (default: us-central1) |
| **Event Keyword** | `HeartScan` | Title keyword to identify your bookings |
| **Timezone** | `Europe/Warsaw` | Your local timezone |

## After Deployment

Once the script completes, you'll see:

```
================================
Deployment Complete! üéâ
================================

Your MeetConfirm service is now running!

Service URL: https://meetconfirm-xxxx.a.run.app
```

### Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check health
curl https://your-service-url.run.app/healthz

# View metrics
curl https://your-service-url.run.app/api/v1/metrics
```

### Test with a Real Booking

1. Create a test booking on your public Google Calendar page
2. Make sure the title contains your keyword (e.g., "HeartScan")
3. Set it for 3+ hours in the future
4. Check your email for the confirmation request

## Costs

For typical usage (10-50 meetings/month):

- **Cloud Run:** ~$0-5/month (generous free tier)
- **Cloud SQL:** ~$7-10/month (smallest tier)
- **Other services:** <$1/month

**Total: ~$7-15/month**

## Troubleshooting

### "gcloud: command not found"

Install the Google Cloud SDK:
```bash
# macOS
brew install google-cloud-sdk

# Linux
curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash

# Windows
# Download from: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install
```

### "client_secret.json not found"

Make sure you:
1. Downloaded the OAuth credentials
2. Saved them as exactly `client_secret.json`
3. Placed them in the project root directory

### "Failed to get refresh token"

This usually means:
- You didn't grant all required permissions
- The browser window closed too early
- Network connectivity issues

**Solution:** Run the deployment script again.

### Calendar events not being detected

Check:
1. The event title contains your exact keyword
2. Calendar watch is active: `curl your-url/api/v1/setup-calendar-watch`
3. The event is >1 hour in the future
4. Logs: `gcloud run logs read --service meetconfirm`

## Manual Deployment (Advanced)

If you prefer to run each step manually, see the `scripts/deploy.ps1` or `scripts/deploy.sh` files for the sequence of commands.

## Customizing Email Templates

Want to change the email text or branding? It's simple:

### Files to Edit:

1. **`app/templates/confirm_email.html`** - Confirmation request email
2. **`app/templates/cancel_email.html`** - Cancellation notice
3. **`app/templates/confirmation_page.html`** - Success page after confirmation

### How to Customize:

1. **Edit the HTML:**
   ```bash
   # Open any template file
   code app/templates/confirm_email.html
   ```

2. **Change what you want:**
   - Text content
   - Colors and styling
   - Add your logo
   - Change button text
   
   **Important:** Don't remove template variables like `{{ confirmation_url }}` - they're needed for functionality!

3. **Redeploy (takes 2-3 minutes):**
   ```bash
   gcloud run deploy meetconfirm \
       --source . \
       --region us-central1 \
       --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
   ```

Done! Your new emails will be sent immediately.

### Available Variables:

Use these in your templates:
- `{{ event_title }}` - Meeting name
- `{{ event_start }}` - Start time
- `{{ event_end }}` - End time
- `{{ timezone }}` - Timezone
- `{{ confirmation_url }}` - Confirmation link (required in confirm_email.html)

## Security Notes

After deployment, the script reminds you to:

```bash
# Remove sensitive files from your local machine
rm client_secret.json google_credentials.json
```

These files are already safely stored in Google Secret Manager and don't need to be kept locally.
