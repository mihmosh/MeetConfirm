# Contributing to MeetConfirm

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MeetConfirm! Itâ€™s people like you that make open source such a great community. We welcome any form of contribution, from documentation and bug reports to feature requests and code changes.

## Ways to Contribute

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug, please open an issue and provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce it.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to an existing one, open an issue to start a discussion.
*   **Pull Requests:** If you're ready to contribute code or documentation, we'd love to see your pull request.

## Getting Started

Since MeetConfirm is designed as a cloud-native application, there is no local development setup. All development and testing should be done in a dedicated Google Cloud project to accurately reflect the production environment.

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3.  **Make your changes** in your forked repository.
4.  **Deploy and test** your changes in your personal GCP project by following the `DEPLOY.md` guide.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
6.  **Push your branch** to your fork on GitHub.
7.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   Ensure your code adheres to the existing style to maintain consistency.
*   Provide a clear description of the problem and solution in your pull request. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
*   Be prepared to discuss your changes and make adjustments as needed during the review process.
